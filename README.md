# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Jean-Baptiste THERY freelance frontend developer specializing in Javascript, **Vue Js** and **Node js**. Available in remote and in BÃ©ziers and Montpellier (France).

## About me

### ðŸ”¥ "If I can dream it, I can do it" ðŸ”¥

I'm not just looking to work, I'm looking to get involved in your projects, I have a real need for accomplishment and professionally, nothing motivates me more than creating things through my passion for code.

I specialized in **Javascript / Typescript** development and more specifically frontend development with **Vue.js**, I also like to do backend, I regularly use **Node js** with Express or Strapi.

I am interested in all types of projects related to my frontend skills. Eternal apprentice, I am always in search of improvement and new things to learn.

I prefer full remote missions but I can travel to Paris, Montpellier and BÃ©ziers.

Listening, humility and communication are for me the keys to a successful collaboration, and I work on myself every day to apply these virtues to what I do.
