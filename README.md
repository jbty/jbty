## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jean-Baptiste THERY, freelance frontend developer specializing in Javascript, **Vue Js** and **Node js**. Available in remote and in BÃ©ziers and Montpellier (France).

## About me

### ðŸ”¥ "If I can dream it, I can do it" ðŸ”¥

Passionate JavaScript / Typescript developer, I specialize in the development of Web and Mobile frontend applications with Vue Js and Node Js.

Proactivity, listening, humility and communication are for me the keys to a successful collaboration. I have a strong need for accomplishment that I live through my passion, the code. Therefore I am not looking to work, I am looking to invest myself in the success of your projects.

Available for freelance missions, only full remote in mainland France and overseas (Dom Tom).
